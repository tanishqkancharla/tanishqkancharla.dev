Hey! 🙋🏾‍♂️ I'm Tanishq. This is my personal website. I mostly use it as a space to express myself.

I love thinking about rich text editors, extensible programming environments, functional programming, and just expressive, fun, robust interfaces to software.

I'm currently looking for my next opportunity. Previously I was [working with Chet Corcos](/blog/what-i-learned). I'm interested in developer tools, tools for creatives and tools for the public good.

In my free time, I play basketball and video games, but I also like to work on projects.
