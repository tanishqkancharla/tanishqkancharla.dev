Hey! 🙋🏾‍♂️ I'm Tanishq. Moonrise is my personal website. I mostly use it as a space to express myself.

I love thinking about rich text editors, extensible programming languages, and just expressive, fun, robust interfaces to software.

I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University majoring in physics and computer science, and I'm currently looking for my next opportunity.

My newest project is Gem, a performant and simple plaintext editor:

I've started to write a blog. I talk mostly about designing new interfaces, making computers better, and my personal life.

I also keep a database of my "thoughts". Just musings about design, engineering, whatever's on my mind.

In my free time, I play basketball and video games, but I also like to work on projects.
